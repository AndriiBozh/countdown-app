# countdown-app

I made this app to get freeCodeCamp 'FrontEnd Development Libraries' certificate.

This is a countdown timer.
It has four main elements: 
sets - which increases/decreases number of sets and shows how many sets are left after session has begun
break - increases/decreases break duration
session time - increases/decreases session duration
timer - shows countdown of session time and break time

after session time expires, a countdown of break time begins
after break time expires, a countdown of session time begins
if there are no more sets left, timer stops and all values (sets, break, session time, timer) are set to their default values

we can pause countdown of session time or break time with a pause button
